=============================
Containers on Spider
=============================

On Spider we support Singularity. Singularity is a container solution
for building software stacks in the form of images. Singularity enables these
images to be run in user space. We dot not provide a space for building
Singularity images, but we do support the execution of these images by users
on Spider.

The currently supported version of Singularity on Spider can be found
by typing ``singularity --version`` on the command line after
:ref:`login <login>` into the system. Additional information can be found
on `Singularity SURFsara`_ page and more generic info can be found at the
`Sylabs documentation`_.
